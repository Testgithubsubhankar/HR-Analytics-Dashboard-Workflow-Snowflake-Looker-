HR Analytics Dashboard Workflow (Snowflake + Looker)

Dashboard- https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/rE_EzlYS_uQ

Over the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to design and deliver a complete HR Planning & Analytics Dashboard, bringing together the power of Snowflake for data engineering and Looker Studio for visual storytelling. Here's a peek into how I brought it all to life:

🔧 Backend – Data Modelling, Profiling, & Optimization with Snowflake
I started by building a robust data pipeline:

🧹 Cleaned & Transformed raw HR data across multiple domains (employee info, compensation, performance, etc.)

🧠 Applied data profiling techniques:

Descriptive Stats: Mean, Median, Mode, Std Dev, Min/Max

Quality Metrics: Null count, Distinct count, Zero values

Frequency Distributions for categorical columns

🏗️ Designed scalable data models using Snowflake best practices

⚙️ Optimized SQL performance using:

Stored procedures for automation

Efficient joins and filters to minimize compute cost

📊 Frontend – Insights with Looker Studio
I translated business questions into interactive dashboards, tracking key KPIs across:

👥 Workforce Overview – Headcount trends, employment status, department distribution

📉 Attrition & Retention – Termination patterns, retention rates, and voluntary vs involuntary exits

🌍 Demographics Analysis – Diversity breakdown by gender, race, age, citizenship, and marital status

💰 Compensation Insights – Pay parity by department, position, gender & race

📈 Performance Management – Score trends, tenure vs performance, and distribution of ratings

🎯 Recruitment Source Effectiveness – Hires by source, performance & retention by source

✨ Tools & Skills Used:

Snowflake SQL (data profiling, transformations, stored procedures)

Looker Studio (dashboarding, KPI analysis)

Data Modeling & Optimization

Storytelling with data for HR stakeholders
